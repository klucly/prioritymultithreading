Time as a showcase




There will spawn a point that would go randomly with each thread moving
it in thread's assigned direction.



Lets take a team:
1) It consists of 4 threads for moving in each direction
2) A memory cell with current point's position

When a thread cuts through the other team's spike, it destroys it:
There is a vector of distances for each point. When a thread replaces
another thread's point, it checks if its still possible to get from the
point with the most distance to the point with less of it and if it cannot
find a path, it would mark a part with more distance as ready for deletion
and add it to the deletion requests handled by a separate thread

There will be the following structures:

MainProgram - a thing that handles all of the showcase stuff
WorkerGroup - a team
Worker - a separate thread
DeletionHandler - a thread for deleting isolated parts
